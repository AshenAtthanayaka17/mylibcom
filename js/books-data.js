        description: "This is just a review about this book ‘Mandodari’ , after 4hours of reading that book it makes me feel that this author written this book while he was high (after using some kind of drug) his way of writing is poor and have no literature at all. It just a book with lot lush like a dumb story in a pornoghraphy video. I did my best to analyse the story until the end to realise that the girl on this book was a schizophrenia patient, but overall this story does not have any wise meaning or anything rather than dumb horny emotions and narrow idea of sex , love and heating!",
